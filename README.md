# MIPAS
MIPAS - merchant's intellectual property authentication system.

THIS IS OUR FINAL PROJECT FOR OUR BACHLER'S DEGREE

every internet store owner is working hard to make his store attractive and beautiful.
our goal is to make a system that assures that if someone stole some images from the store and uses them in another store,
even if some manipulation is done on the image, to create a report of all suspected thefts.

this product will be open-source after we'll submit the project.
PLEASE DO NOT CONTRIBUTE UNTIL AUGUST 2020.
